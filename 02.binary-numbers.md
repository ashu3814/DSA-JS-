## 1. What is Binary? (The Basics)

Computers, at their core, understand only two states: **ON** or **OFF**. These states are represented by numbers:
*   **ON** is represented by `1`
*   **OFF** is represented by `0`

This system of using only `0`s and `1`s is called **binary** or **base-2**.

### Decimal (Base-10) vs. Binary (Base-2)

We humans typically use the **decimal** system (base-10), which has ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

Let's look at the number `123` in decimal:
*   `3` is in the "ones" place (10<sup>0</sup>) => `3 * 1 = 3`
*   `2` is in the "tens" place (10<sup>1</sup>) => `2 * 10 = 20`
*   `1` is in the "hundreds" place (10<sup>2</sup>) => `1 * 100 = 100`
*   Total: `100 + 20 + 3 = 123`

Binary (base-2) works similarly, but uses powers of 2 and only two digits (0 and 1).
Let's look at the binary number `1011`:
*   `1` (rightmost) is in the "ones" place (2<sup>0</sup>) => `1 * 1 = 1`
*   `1` is in the "twos" place (2<sup>1</sup>) => `1 * 2 = 2`
*   `0` is in the "fours" place (2<sup>2</sup>) => `0 * 4 = 0`
*   `1` (leftmost) is in the "eights" place (2<sup>3</sup>) => `1 * 8 = 8`
*   Total: `8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11` (in decimal)

So, `1011` in binary is `11` in decimal.

### Bits and Bytes

*   **Bit**: A single binary digit (`0` or `1`). It's the smallest unit of data in a computer.
*   **Byte**: A group of 8 bits. A byte can represent `2^8 = 256` different values (from `00000000` to `11111111`).


Example of a Byte: 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
| | | | | | | Each is a Bit
(Most Significant Bit - MSB) (Least Significant Bit - LSB)

## 2. Converting Between Decimal and Binary

### Decimal to Binary (Manual Method)

To convert a decimal number to binary, you can use the "division by 2" method:
1.  Divide the decimal number by 2.
2.  Write down the remainder (which will be 0 or 1).
3.  Use the quotient from the division as the new number and repeat step 1.
4.  Continue until the quotient is 0.
5.  The binary number is the sequence of remainders, read from **bottom to top**.

**Example: Convert Decimal 13 to Binary**

| Division        | Quotient | Remainder |
| :-------------- | :------- | :-------- |
| 13 / 2          | 6        | **1** (LSB) |
| 6 / 2           | 3        | **0**       |
| 3 / 2           | 1        | **1**       |
| 1 / 2           | 0        | **1** (MSB) |

Reading remainders from bottom to top: `1101`.
So, decimal `13` is `1101` in binary.

### Binary to Decimal (Manual Method)

To convert a binary number to decimal:
1.  Write down the binary number.
2.  Underneath each bit, write its corresponding power of 2, starting from 2<sup>0</sup> on the right.
3.  Multiply each bit by its corresponding power of 2.
4.  Add up the results.

**Example: Convert Binary `1101` to Decimal**

Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Binary: 1 1 0 1
Power of 2: 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0
Value: 8 4 2 1

Calculation:
(1 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (1 * 1)
= 8 + 4 + 0 + 1
= 13

So, binary `1101` is `13` in decimal.

## 3. Binary in JavaScript

JavaScript provides easy ways to work with binary representations.

### Binary Literals (Writing Binary Numbers)

You can write numbers directly in binary format in your JavaScript code by prefixing them with `0b` (or `0B`).

```javascript
let binaryNum1 = 0b101; // Represents decimal 5
let binaryNum2 = 0b1111; // Represents decimal 15

console.log(binaryNum1); // Output: 5
console.log(binaryNum2); // Output: 15

let sum = 0b10 + 0b01; // 2 + 1
console.log(sum);      // Output: 3
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Converting Numbers to Binary Strings (.toString(2))

The toString() method of a Number object can convert it to a string representation in a specified base (radix). For binary, use radix 2.

let decimalNum = 13;
let binaryString = decimalNum.toString(2);
console.log(binaryString); // Output: "1101"

let anotherNum = 42;
console.log(anotherNum.toString(2)); // Output: "101010"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Note: This produces a string, not a number.

Converting Binary Strings to Numbers (parseInt(..., 2))

The parseInt() global function can parse a string and return an integer. Its second argument specifies the base of the number in the string. For binary, use base 2.

let binaryStr = "1101";
let decimalValue = parseInt(binaryStr, 2);
console.log(decimalValue); // Output: 13

let anotherBinaryStr = "101010";
console.log(parseInt(anotherBinaryStr, 2)); // Output: 42

console.log(parseInt("111", 2)); // Output: 7
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Caution: If the string is not a valid binary number (e.g., contains digits other than 0 or 1), parseInt() might return NaN or an unexpected result based on the parsable part.

4. Why is Binary Important?

Computer Hardware: As mentioned, computers operate on ON/OFF electrical signals, perfectly modeled by binary.

Data Representation: All data (numbers, text, images, videos) is ultimately stored and processed as binary.

Low-Level Operations: Understanding binary is crucial for low-level programming, device drivers, and embedded systems.

Bitwise Operations: Many programming tasks, like setting flags, compressing data, or encryption, involve manipulating individual bits.

Networking: Data packets transmitted over networks are sequences of bits.

5. Bitwise Operators (A First Look)

Bitwise operators work directly on the binary representations of numbers. They treat their operands as sequences of 32 bits (0s and 1s).

Operator	Name	Description
&	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
`	`	OR
^	XOR (Exclusive OR)	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1.
~	NOT	Inverts all the bits.
<<	Left Shift	Shifts bits to the left, filling with zeros.
>>	Right Shift (Sign-propagating)	Shifts bits to the right, preserving the sign.
>>>	Right Shift (Zero-fill)	Shifts bits to the right, filling with zeros.

Let's see simple examples:

Let a = 5 (binary 0101) and b = 3 (binary 0011).
(For simplicity, we'll show fewer bits than 32)

AND (&)

If both bits in the same position are 1, the result bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

0101  (5)
& 0011  (3)

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
OR (|)

If at least one bit in the same position is 1, the result bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

JavaScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
XOR (^)

If bits in the same position are different, the result bit is 1; if they are the same, it's 0.

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
NOT (~)

Inverts all bits. If a bit is 1, it becomes 0; if 0, it becomes 1. JavaScript performs this on a 32-bit signed integer.
This can be a bit tricky for beginners because of how negative numbers are represented (Two's Complement).
~x is roughly equivalent to -(x + 1).

// For 5 (00...0101)
// ~5 would be 11...1010 which represents -6 in two's complement
console.log(~5); // Output: -6
console.log(~0); // Output: -1

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Left Shift (<<)

Shifts all bits to the left by a specified number of positions. New bits on the right are filled with zeros.
x << y is equivalent to x * (2^y).

0101 (5) << 1  => 1010 (10)
  0101 (5) << 2  => 10100 (20)

Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
console.log(5 << 1); // Output: 10 (5 * 2^1)
console.log(5 << 2); // Output: 20 (5 * 2^2)
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
JavaScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Right Shift (>> and >>>)

>> (Sign-propagating Right Shift): Shifts bits to the right. Copies of the leftmost bit (sign bit) are filled in on the left. If the number is positive, 0s are filled. If negative, 1s are filled.
x >> y is roughly floor(x / (2^y)).

0101 (5) >> 1  => 0010 (2)
  1010 (10) >> 1 => 0101 (5)
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy

Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
console.log(5 >> 1);  // Output: 2
console.log(-5 >> 1); // Output: -3 (behavior with negative numbers due to sign propagation)

Use code with caution.
JavaScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

>>> (Zero-fill Right Shift): Shifts bits to the right. New bits on the left are always filled with zeros, regardless of the sign.

0101 (5) >>> 1  => 0010 (2)

6. JavaScript Number Representation (Important Note)

All numbers in JavaScript are internally represented as 64-bit floating-point numbers (IEEE 754 standard).

However, bitwise operations in JavaScript operate on 32-bit signed integers.

When a bitwise operation is performed:

The JavaScript number is converted to a 32-bit integer.

The bitwise operation is performed.

The result (a 32-bit integer) is converted back to a JavaScript 64-bit floating-point number.

This is important to remember, especially when dealing with numbers outside the 32-bit integer range or with fractional numbers (bitwise operations on them will effectively truncate the fractional part).

7. Practical Examples & Visualizations
Permissions Example

Bitwise operators are great for managing sets of flags or permissions. Each bit can represent a specific permission.

const PERM_READ = 0b001;    // Decimal 1
const PERM_WRITE = 0b010;   // Decimal 2
const PERM_EXECUTE = 0b100; // Decimal 4

// Assign permissions
let userPermissions = PERM_READ | PERM_WRITE; // 0b001 | 0b010 = 0b011 (Decimal 3)

// Check for a permission
function hasPermission(permissions, permissionToCheck) {
  return (permissions & permissionToCheck) === permissionToCheck;
}

console.log("User Permissions (Binary):", userPermissions.toString(2)); // "11" (leading zeros often omitted)
console.log("User can read?", hasPermission(userPermissions, PERM_READ));     // true
console.log("User can write?", hasPermission(userPermissions, PERM_WRITE));    // true
console.log("User can execute?", hasPermission(userPermissions, PERM_EXECUTE)); // false

// Add execute permission
userPermissions = userPermissions | PERM_EXECUTE; // 0b011 | 0b100 = 0b111 (Decimal 7)
console.log("User can now execute?", hasPermission(userPermissions, PERM_EXECUTE)); // true

// Remove write permission (using AND with NOT of the permission)
userPermissions = userPermissions & ~PERM_WRITE; // PERM_WRITE = 010, ~PERM_WRITE (in context) = 101
                                                 // 111 & 101 = 101 (Decimal 5)
console.log("User can still write?", hasPermission(userPermissions, PERM_WRITE)); // false
console.log("User Permissions (Binary):", userPermissions.toString(2)); // "101"

Visualization of Permissions:

Permission	Binary	Decimal
READ	001	1
WRITE	010	2
EXECUTE	100	4

User has READ + WRITE: 001 | 010 = 011

Check for READ: 011 & 001 = 001 (Matches READ, so has permission)

Check for EXECUTE: 011 & 100 = 000 (Does NOT match EXECUTE, no permission)

8. Summary & Next Steps

Binary (Base-2) uses 0s and 1s to represent numbers.

A bit is one binary digit; a byte is 8 bits.

JS allows binary literals (0b101).

Use num.toString(2) to get a binary string and parseInt(str, 2) to convert a binary string to a number.

Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>) manipulate individual bits of numbers (treated as 32-bit integers).

Understanding binary helps in understanding data storage, low-level operations, and specific algorithms.

Next Steps:

Practice: Convert numbers between decimal and binary manually.

Experiment: Play with binary literals and conversion functions in the JS console.

Explore Bitwise Operators: Try out all bitwise operators with different numbers. See how they affect the binary representation.

Challenges: Look for simple coding challenges that can be solved efficiently using bitwise operations (e.g., checking if a number is even/odd, swapping two numbers without a temp variable using XOR).

Happy coding!
